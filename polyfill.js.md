Polyfill Bundle
---------------
[script](polyfill.js)

Since many of the Web standards polyfills require ES5 or ES2015 support,
a bundle is provided that includes nearly everything.

polyfill.js is a concatenation of the following files:

es5.js - ECMAScript 5 polyfills
es6.js - ECMAScript 2015 polyfills
es2016.js - ECMAScript 2016 polyfills
es2017.js - ECMAScript 2017 polyfills
web.js (which is itself a concatenation of files)

polyfill.min.js is a minimized version, c/o http://javascript-minifier.com
